Comment:
========
The goal for this project is to extract as much crypto data from coingecko api as possible.
I'm currently in the process of running through all methods of the pycoingecko library,
understanding and organising the data. Phase 2 would be to create a database that holds
all the data. Phase 3 would be to create visual representations of the data. Phase 4 would
be to integrate this project with my website https://tristan0scot0soldenhoff.pythonanywhere.com/

Files:
